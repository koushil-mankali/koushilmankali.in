## SECURITY and PERFORMENCE :

---

-> Used tokens for Remember Me functionality instead of storing passwords in the user browser cookies for better security.

-> Used hashed values to identify each course uniqly and to escape from user manupulations in the URL to access other courses (accessing other courses just by changing / manupulating course details in URL).

-> Passwords are hased before stronging in the database and for hasing i have used PHP's default but strong encryption algorithm and it will also verify passwords when a user login.

-> For better security i have used PHP PDO for sql query.

-> For better code utilization i have created functions for each query and called it when ever required so code repitation is decreased a lot.

## Remember Me Functionality Info :

---

==> Here for Remember Me functionality while login we have used tokens which will be stroed in the database and also in the user browser cookies, whenever a user login and checks the remember me box a token will be generated for the first time and stored in the database also in the browser cookie and next time when a user trys to login from the same browser and if there is a token avaliable in the browser cookie then it will be compaired with token in the database if it matches user will be logged in and a new token is generated and this new token will be replaced with old token in the database and browser cookie in case if the token didn't match then user will not be allowed to login unless they enter the password.

Stack Used : PHP and MySQL

## How to use this Project :

---

->First you have need to do some changes in the file / add some details which are mentioned below.

1. As this project has E-Mail conformation feature which uses SMTP you need a mail account so you have to add you'r mail id details in required file to run SMTP feature.

->Add you'r email account details in

- signup.php // line no. 46,47
- instructor/signup.php //line no. 46,47

Now as we use Paytm payment gateway in this project we need to specify paytm merchant account details in the file "database/keys.php".
It is (keys.php) is imported in paytm gateway file so you have to mention you'r merchant id and key here and it will be automatically be imported to paytm gatway file.

To get some sample data in you'r course videos section replicate the video file in "videos folder" with following names (dont forget to provied exact .m4v extension as it is saved in database as .m4v).

**sample video names (which you should use to get sample data):**

5fdedb4c957bevideo.m4v 5fe497a3870b5video.m4v 5fe497b4eb1cavideo.m4v 5fe497e6721c4video.m4v 5fe497f8483ccvideo.m4v 5fe498e250eb6video.m4v 5fe4978c06613video.m4v 5fe4989e0e791video.m4v 5fe4993c72623video.m4v 5fe49883da0abvideo.m4v 5fe498251dd5cvideo.m4v 5fe499117788avideo.m4v

and there you go the project is ready to use.
